 * baseURL's scheme when useSecureCookies is left unset (see
 * node_modules/better-auth/dist/cookies/index.mjs). A previous version of this
 * file passed `secure: NODE_ENV === 'production'` via defaultCookieAttributes,
 * which is spread in *after* that computed default and so silently overrode
 * it: any production deployment not yet behind HTTPS (a fresh docker-compose
 * host, a LAN address, a domain without a cert yet) forced Secure onto a
 * cookie issued over plain HTTP. Browsers refuse to store a Secure cookie set
 * from a non-HTTPS origin (localhost is exempted, which is why this was easy
 * to miss testing locally) — so sign-in would 200 with a Set-Cookie header
 * the browser silently discarded. The very next request, cookie-less, read as
 * signed out: an instant "logged out" on the first click, and a login that
 * never survived a refresh.
